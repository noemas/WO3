     the Fermi energy is     9.1771 ev

!    total energy              =   -6260.69501273 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =   -6260.69501273 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          6.1E-10 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =   -4824.72780896 Ry
     hartree contribution      =    2645.49776976 Ry
     xc contribution           =    -966.33140583 Ry
     ewald contribution        =   -3115.13352503 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.00004267 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  16 iterations
