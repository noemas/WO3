     the Fermi energy is     9.1374 ev

!    total energy              =   -6260.69453098 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =   -6260.69453098 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          7.5E-10 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =   -4830.72699971 Ry
     hartree contribution      =    2648.19475194 Ry
     xc contribution           =    -966.33136326 Ry
     ewald contribution        =   -3111.83086137 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.00005859 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  16 iterations
