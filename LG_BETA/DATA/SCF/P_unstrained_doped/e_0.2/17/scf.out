     the Fermi energy is     8.8781 ev

!    total energy              =   -6260.95563022 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =   -6260.95563022 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          3.4E-10 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =   -4849.45239531 Ry
     hartree contribution      =    2655.37766777 Ry
     xc contribution           =    -965.89648625 Ry
     ewald contribution        =   -3100.98440793 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.00000849 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  16 iterations
