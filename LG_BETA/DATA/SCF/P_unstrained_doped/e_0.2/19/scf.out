     the Fermi energy is     8.7936 ev

!    total energy              =   -6260.95237418 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =   -6260.95237418 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          3.4E-10 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =   -4856.67083550 Ry
     hartree contribution      =    2658.63902270 Ry
     xc contribution           =    -965.89811836 Ry
     ewald contribution        =   -3097.02243601 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.00000700 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  16 iterations
