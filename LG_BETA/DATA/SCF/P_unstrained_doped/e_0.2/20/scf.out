     the Fermi energy is     8.7557 ev

!    total energy              =   -6260.95074655 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =   -6260.95074655 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          2.8E-10 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =   -4859.60869334 Ry
     hartree contribution      =    2659.96700959 Ry
     xc contribution           =    -965.89872078 Ry
     ewald contribution        =   -3095.41033553 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.00000649 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  16 iterations
