     the Fermi energy is     8.9248 ev

!    total energy              =   -6260.95723478 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =   -6260.95723478 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          4.4E-10 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =   -4845.16167564 Ry
     hartree contribution      =    2653.44208988 Ry
     xc contribution           =    -965.89582783 Ry
     ewald contribution        =   -3103.34181165 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.00000953 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  16 iterations
