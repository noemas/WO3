     the Fermi energy is     9.2014 ev

!    total energy              =   -6260.42276504 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =   -6260.42276504 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          7.9E-10 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =   -4858.70640120 Ry
     hartree contribution      =    2662.07768206 Ry
     xc contribution           =    -966.77159417 Ry
     ewald contribution        =   -3097.02243601 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.00001573 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  16 iterations
