     the Fermi energy is     9.9318 ev

!    total energy              =   -6260.39963153 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =   -6260.39963153 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          2.3E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =   -4744.34668186 Ry
     hartree contribution      =    2610.77979003 Ry
     xc contribution           =    -966.77534567 Ry
     ewald contribution        =   -3160.05732656 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.00006746 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  16 iterations
