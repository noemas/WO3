     Parallel version (MPI), running on    40 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     4 nodes
     K-points division:     npool     =      40
     Reading input from scf.in

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used

     Found symmetry operation: I + ( -0.5000  0.0000 -0.5000)
     This is a supercell, fractional translations are disabled
     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead

     hartree contribution      =    2599.09601223 Ry
     xc contribution           =    -966.06537028 Ry
     ewald contribution        =   -3171.28112790 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.00004311 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  15 iterations
